I am a Spanish Computer Engineer with a degree from Carlos III University of Madrid achieved in mid 2023. On the same year I was able to finish my first big project that consisted on applying automated planning and pattern recognition models to perform tasks within the AI2THOR simulation environment.

Over the past year, I have mainly developed expertise in frontend development through my work at Empathy.co, where I helped build an understandable, trustworthy, and joyful search experience. I am proud to have been involved in projects such as their multiple corporative websites, WYSIWYG, and their Playboard. Not only have I developed my programming skills, but I've also enhanced my collaborative and adaptability competences by working on multiple projects and communicating with teams in other areas of expertise.

My main desire is to continue learning in the field of technology and develop my skills without limiting myself to a specific path.
