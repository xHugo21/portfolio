I am a Spanish Computer Engineer, graduated from Carlos III University of Madrid in 2023.

In the early stages of my career, I focused on developing my expertise in frontend development while working at Empathy.co, a company based in Gij√≥n. This role allowed me to deepen my technical skills and contribute to impactful projects.

Outside of work, I am passionate about continuous learning and expanding my knowledge in various areas of technology. Through self-study, personal projects, and staying updated with industry trends, I constantly strive to enhance my skills. This commitment to growth enables me to adapt to the fast-paced and ever-evolving nature of the tech industry.
